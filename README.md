**Rouxinol.ai** (Portuguese for *Nightingale*) is an open-source, AI-powered voice interface that lets you control your entire desktop — and soon your smartphone — using only your voice. Built by [Labirinto.ai](https://labirinto.ai), Rouxinol reimagines how humans interact with computers: naturally, intuitively, and hands-free.
